My game is about a doggy daycare worker who needs to return on of the dogs to its owner, who is waiting at the front desk. It is not a simple task, however, as the dog in question is having a hard time getting up. The player has to figure out, using items found in the different rooms, how to get the dog to get up so that the player can hand them back over to their owner. I chose this game because it is relatively simple and still allows for an exploratory text-adventure with a couple of puzzles that you need to get through. I am also a huge dog person, and all four of the dogs are dogs that my family has or had. Each of the puzzle/actions also resembles something notable about the actual dog in real life (personality, favorite toy, etc.).
